# HomeKey - Property Intelligence Platform

A comprehensive real estate platform that transforms scattered property information into clear, reliable insights for confident property decisions.

## üèóÔ∏è System Design & Architecture

### Core Approach

Built as a **2-hour technical interview demonstration**, HomeKey showcases a full-stack property intelligence platform with real-time data processing, user authentication, and comprehensive property search capabilities.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes with Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive property data
- **Authentication**: Clerk for user management and webhooks
- **Deployment**: Production-ready with optimized builds

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Property Search & Discovery**

- **Comprehensive Property Data**: 50+ properties across multiple cities with realistic neighborhood scores
- **Advanced Filtering**: Price range, location, property type, bedrooms, bathrooms
- **Smart Sorting**: By price, walkability, bike score, transit accessibility
- **Real-time Search**: Debounced search with URL state management

### 2. **User Experience**

- **Authentication**: Seamless sign-up/sign-in with Clerk
- **User Management**: Favorites, search history, personalized dashboard
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with modern UI/UX
- **Interactive Elements**: Heart icons for favorites, clickable search history

### 3. **Data Architecture**

- **Normalized Database**: Properties, neighborhoods, user data with proper relationships
- **Location Intelligence**: Walkability, bike, and transit scores per neighborhood
- **Market Analytics**: Real-time market insights and trends
- **User Behavior Tracking**: Search patterns and preferences

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Design

```sql
-- Core entities with proper relationships
properties ‚Üí neighborhoods (walkability, bike, transit scores)
users ‚Üí favorites, searches, preferences
property_images ‚Üí properties (with caching)
```

### API Architecture

- **RESTful Design**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with Prisma
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- **Performance**: Optimized queries with proper indexing

### Frontend Architecture

- **Component-Based**: Reusable PropertyCard, PropertyImage components
- **State Management**: React hooks with custom useFavorites hook
- **URL State**: Search parameters synced with browser history
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Next.js 15 compatibility for dynamic content

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs & Design Decisions

### 1. **Data Sources**

**Decision**: Used realistic mock data instead of real estate APIs
**Trade-off**:

- ‚úÖ Fast development, no API costs, consistent data
- ‚ùå Not real-time market data, limited to demo properties

### 2. **Image Handling**

**Decision**: Unsplash API with caching and hash-based selection
**Trade-off**:

- ‚úÖ High-quality images, no storage costs
- ‚ùå External dependency, potential rate limits

### 3. **Authentication**

**Decision**: Clerk for complete auth solution
**Trade-off**:

- ‚úÖ Production-ready, webhook integration, security
- ‚ùå Third-party dependency, potential vendor lock-in

### 4. **Database Queries**

**Decision**: Raw SQL with Prisma for complex analytics
**Trade-off**:

- ‚úÖ Performance, flexibility for complex queries
- ‚ùå Less type safety, more maintenance overhead

### 5. **Build Optimization**

**Decision**: Fixed all TypeScript errors for production build
**Trade-off**:

- ‚úÖ Production-ready, type safety, maintainability
- ‚ùå More development time, stricter constraints

## üöÄ What I'd Do With More Time

### 1. **Real Data Integration** (Week 1-2)

- **MLS Integration**: Connect to real estate APIs (Zillow, Realtor.com)
- **Property Photos**: Implement image upload and management
- **Market Data**: Real-time pricing, neighborhood trends
- **Geocoding**: Accurate coordinates and mapping integration

### 2. **Advanced Intelligence** (Week 3-4)

- **ML Recommendations**: Property matching based on user behavior and preferences
- **Market Predictions**: Price forecasting using historical data
- **Neighborhood Analysis**: Crime rates, school ratings, amenities
- **Investment Analytics**: ROI calculations, rental yield estimates

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience** (Week 5-6)

- **Advanced Filters**: More property features, commute times
- **Enhanced Property Details**: More detailed property information and features
- **Saved Searches**: Email alerts for new matching properties
- **Mobile App**: React Native version for mobile users

### 4. **Performance & Scale** (Week 7-8)

- **Caching Layer**: Redis for frequently accessed data
- **Search Optimization**: Elasticsearch for complex property searches
- **Image CDN**: CloudFront for global image delivery
- **Database Optimization**: Read replicas, query optimization

### 5. **Business Features** (Week 9-10)

- **Agent Integration**: Connect with real estate agents
- **Mortgage Calculator**: Integrated financing tools
- **Property Tours**: Virtual tour scheduling
- **Document Management**: Contract and document storage
